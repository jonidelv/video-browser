Whoever\n * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\n * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\n * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\n * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\n * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n * they only require implementing two methods.\n *\n * <pre>\n *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n *                                      +        +\n *                                      |        |\n *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n *                    |                 v        |              |\n *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n * </pre>\n *\n * Use cases:\n * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n *   content.\n * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n *\n * Transactional plugin API:\n * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n *\n * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n *\n * @class Transaction\n */\nvar Mixin = {\n  /**\n   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.
